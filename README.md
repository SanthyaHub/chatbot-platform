# My Chatbot Platform! ðŸ¤–

Hi! This is my school assignment: A simple app where you sign up, make a chatbot project, and chat with it (fake AI for fun).

## What It Does
- Sign up and log in (safe passwords).
- Create a project with special instructions for the bot.
- Chat: Send a message and get a reply (uses your instructions).

## How to Run It (Easy Steps)
1. Download my code: Go to [GitHub link] and click green "Code" â†’ "Download ZIP".
2. Unzip to a folder (e.g., Desktop/chatbot).
3. Open in VSCode: File â†’ Open Folder â†’ Pick the folder.
4. Open Terminal (bottom): Type `pip install flask flask-jwt-extended flask-cors python-dotenv` â†’ Enter (installs stuff).
5. Type `python app.py` â†’ Enter. See "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"? It's on!
6. Test: Use Thunder Client (VSCode extensionâ€”install if needed). 
   - POST /register: {"email": "kid@test.com", "password": "123"}
   - POST /login: Same â†’ Get token.
   - POST /projects (add token header): {"name": "Fun Bot", "prompts": "Be silly!"}
   - POST /chat/1 (add token): {"message": "Hi!"} â†’ Get reply.
